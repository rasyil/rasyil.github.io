<Center><h1>DEAD POETS SOCIETY</h1></Center>

<p>A compilation of quotes I love from DPS</p>

<p>Carpe diem, seize the day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.</p>

<p> "I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life."</p>

<p> Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.</p>

<p> We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, "O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless... of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?" Answer. That you are here - that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?</p>

<p>"To put to rout all that was not life; and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived."</p>

<p>There's a time for daring and there's a time for caution, and a wise man understands which is called for.</p>

<p>Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll never be enough. You kick at it, beat it, it'll never cover any of us. From the moment we enter crying t-to the moment we leave dying, it'll just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream.</p>

<p>I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way.</p>

<p>Now we all have a great need for acceptance, but you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may go</p>

<p> I was good. I was really good.</p>

<p>"Dead Poets' Honor."
    "What is that?"
    "My word."</p>

<p> To indeed be a God!</p>

<p>"To put to rout all that was not life; and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived."</p>
